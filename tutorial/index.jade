    ## What Does This Thing Do?

    This application allows you to make a phone call from your browser using
    [Twilio Client](https://www.twilio.com/client).

    It also includes a couple other standard features you would expect a
    browser phone to have:

    1. Mute and unmute microphone input
    1. Send DTMF touch tones using the HTML key pad

    This tutorial highlights the key bits of code that make this application
    work. [Check out the project README on GitHub](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/browser-dialer-angular)
    to see how to run the code yourself.

    Let's get started.

    ## Create a Twilio Application

    This application requires a TwiML application to make a phone call, in this
    step we'll show you how to create it.

    To create a TwiML App open you
    [Console](//www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/dev-tools/twiml-apps) and
    click the button "Create new TwiML App".

    ![New Twiml App](//howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/new-twiml-app.png)

    Every TwiML application needs a friendly name (we called ours “Browser
    Dialer”) and either a Voice URL or a Messaging URL. Since we want our users
    to make phone calls, we used a URL to our application’s “/voice” route.

    **Note:** When running the app locally, you can use a tool like
    [ngrok](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2013/10/test-your-webhooks-locally-with-ngrok.html)
    to get a publicly accessible URL for your development environment.

    ## Generate a Capability Token

    Before our users can make any calls in their browsers, we need to create a
    capability token for them.

    Capability tokens are your way to control exactly what your users can and
    can't do with Twilio Client. In this case, our server will provide all users
    with tokens that allow them to make outbound phone calls.

    We use the [Twilio Node Helper Library](//www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/node)
    to generate and configure a capability token with the SID of our Twilio
    Application to allow outgoing calls.

    ## Set Up the Twilio Device

    In our client-side code we start by [including the Twilio.js library](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/client/twilio-js#including-js).

    We then retrieve the capability token from the route **/token** with a POST
    request using jQuery.

    Lastly, we pass our token to `Twilio.Device.setup()` to finish the setup.

    The `Twilio.Device.ready()` callback is used to notify us when the device is
    ready to make calls.

    ## Make a Call

    Now that Twilio Client is ready, our users can start making phone calls.
    They'll start by inputting the phone number they wish to call.

    We massage that input before passing the number on to Twilio, adding a **+**
    sign, then a country code, and the actual number. This is called the
    [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format and is required by most
    parts of Twilio's API.

    We then use `Twilio.Device.connect()` to start the call. Twilio will send a
    request to the URL you specified in your Twilio Application configuration,
    looking for instructions on how to handle the call.

    In this case, we include the phone number the user wishes to dial in our
    `connect()` call, and we then access it in
    [our server-side code here](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/browser-dialer-angular/blob/master/index.js).

    ## Mute and Unmute an Active Call

    Sometimes you want to mute or unmute the current call, halting input
    from the user's microphone.

    We can use `Twilio.Device.activeConnection()` to get the active call,
    and then call its `mute()` method to mute or unmute the user's microphone.

    ## Send DTMF Tones

    If our user calls an automated phone system, they might need to navigate
    a menu system using our phone's keypad and DTMF tones.

    DTMF stands for "Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling" and are the familiar
    sounds you hear when dialing a phone. DTMF have been standardized so
    they can be understood and decoded by machines.

    To play DTMF tones with the Twilio.js client library we use the
    `sendDigits` method, passing which digit the user pressed as our sole
    argument.

    ## Hang up the Call

    Lastly, our users should be able to end a call.

    To achive this we use `Twilio.Device.disconnectAll()`, which terminates the
    current call.

    ## Where to Next?

    That's it! We crafted an application that allows our users to make
    browser-to-phone calls using Twilio.js.
